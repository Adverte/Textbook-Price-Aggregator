Using github:
=============
1. create a github account and let Andre know your username and he will add you as a collaborator
2. fork the project from Andre's project page (https://github.com/andrewiggins/Textbook-Price-Aggregator). You know have a copy of the repository in your repositories. Any changes you make will not be automatically added to the main repository (which is Andre's as he created it)
3. clone, edit, commit, push at will
4. when you want to combine with main repository, submit a pull request from Andre's project page and he'll combine it.

2. **clone** your github repository using the SSH link in your project page.
   - only done the first time. use **pull** to update your local repository from your github repository
3. do what ever changes you want
4. **commit** the changes using -am "<insert commit message here about what you did>"
5. when you want to **push** your commits to github use the command **push** as outlined on the reference page
6. when you want all of your commits to be added to the main repository, submit a pull request on Andre's project page
